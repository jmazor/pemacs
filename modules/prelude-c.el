;;; Code:

(require 'prelude-prog)
(require 'google-c-style)

;; Sets google c style
(add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'google-set-c-style)
;; Automatically connect to ccls lsp server
(add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'eglot-ensure)

;; While I enjoy how minimal eglot is my reason for not using lsp-mode is I could not get cpplint flycheck to coexist
;; Eglot uses flymake so flymake and flycheck are being run
;; Please note I use  cpplint flycheck as an educative resource. I turn it off when reading code I did not write (for obvious reasons)
;; I do not have any intention at them moment to auto format programs other than enabling c style

;; TODO test company c irony

(provide 'prelude-c)
