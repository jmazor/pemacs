;;; Code:

;; TODO what is this
;; show the name of the current function definition in the modeline
(require 'which-func)
(which-function-mode 1)

;; move this if I ever make a porg.el
;; font-lock annotations like TODO in source code
(require 'hl-todo)
(global-hl-todo-mode 1)

;; in Emacs 24 programming major modes generally derive from a common
;; mode named prog-mode; for others, we'll arrange for our mode
;; defaults function to run prelude-prog-mode-hook directly.  To
;; augment and/or counteract these defaults your own function
;; to prelude-prog-mode-hook, using:
;;
;;     (add-hook 'prelude-prog-mode-hook 'my-prog-mode-defaults t)
;;
;; (the final optional t sets the *append* argument)

;; smart curly braces

;; enlist a more liberal guru
;;(setq guru-warn-only t)


;; enable on-the-fly syntax checking
(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-flycheck-mode)
(provide 'prelude-c)
