# pemacs
My personal emacs config. Based on prelude - https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude

Install Guide:

git clone https://github.com/molezs/pemacs.git ~/.emacs.d

M-x recompile-init after install

After install:

Change /modules/prelude-company.el and /modules/cpplint.el directories for your machine

create a .gnus.el if you want to use gnus mail reader

If anyone ever uses this you are encouraged to fork your own copy and modify /core/prelude-packages.el and the rest of the config to your own liking. Packages installed are modified via /modules/modules.el and their respective files.
/vendor is for packages not included in melpa.

This is my personal config please let me know if you come across any personal information accidently included.It will be updated whenever my config changes so do not expect stability. I recommend forking your own copy.
